# Route53_LatencyRouting

For example, suppose you have **ELB load balancers** in the **US West (Oregon)** Region andin the **Asia Pacific (Singapore)** Region.You created a latency record for each load balancer. Here's what happens whena user in London enters the nameof your domain in a browser: 

1. DNS routes the query to a Route 53 name server.
2. Route 53 refers to its data on latency **between London and the Singapore region** and **between Londonand the Oregon region**. 
3. If latency is lower between the London and Oregon regions, Route 53 responds to thequery with the IP addressfor the Oregon load balancer. If latency is lower between London and the Singaporeregion, Route 53 responds with the IP addressfor the Singapore load balancer. 

Latency between hosts on the internet can change over time as a result of changesin network connectivity and routing.Latency-based routing is based on latency measurements performed over a periodof time, and the measurements reflectthese changes. **A request that is routed to the Oregon region this week might berouted to the Singapore region next week**.
