**Your system recently experienced down time during the troubleshooting process. You found that a new administrator mistakenly terminated several production EC2 instances. Which of the following strategies will help prevent a similar situation in the future? The administrator still must be able to: launch, start stop, and terminate development resources & launch and start production instances.**

- a. Create an lAM user, which is not allowed to terminate instances by leveraging production EC2 termination protection.
- b. Leverage resource based tagging along with an lAM user, which can prevent specific users from terminating production EC2 resources. 
- c. Leverage EC2 termination protection and multi-factor authentication, which together require users to authenticate before terminating EC2 instances
- d. Create an lAM user and apply an lAM role which prevents users from terminating production EC2 instances.
