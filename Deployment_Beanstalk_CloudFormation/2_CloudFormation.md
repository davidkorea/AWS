# Benefits of AWS CloudFormation
- Infrastructure as code
  - **No resources are manually created**, which is excellent for control
  - The **code can be version controlled** for example using **git**
  - **Changes** to the infrastructure are **reviewed through code**
  
- Cost
  - Each resources within the stack is stagged监视 with an identifier so you can easily see how much a stack costs you
  - You can **estimate the costs** of your resources using the CloudFormation template
  - Savings strategy: In Dev, you could automation **deletion of templates at 5 PM and recreated at 8 AM** safely
