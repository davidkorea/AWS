- Alternative to other build tools such as **Jenkins**
- Continuous scaling (no servers to manage or provision â€“ no build queue)
- Pay for usage: **the time it takes** to complete the builds
- Leverages **Docker under the hood** for reproducible builds
- Possibility to **extend capabilities** leveraging our **own base Docker images**
- Secure: Integration with KMS for encryption of build artifacts, IAM for build permissions, and VPC for network security, CloudTrail for API calls logging
