-  All Load Balancers have health check capability
- Application Load Balancers for HTTP / HTTPs & Websocket
- Network Load Balancer for TCP
- **CLB and ALB** support **SSL certificates** and provide SSL termination
- **Stickiness works for CLB & ALB**



# 1. ALB

- Stickiness can be enabled at the target group level
  - Same request goes to the same instance
  - Stickiness is directly generated by the ALB (not the application)
- ALB support HTTP/HTTPS & Websockets protocols
- The application servers donâ€™t see the IP of the client directly
  - The true IP of the client is inserted in the header **X-Forwarded-For**
  - We can also get **Port (X-Forwarded-Port)** and **proto (X-Forwarded-Proto)**

- ALB can route on based on hostname / path
- ALB is a great fit with ECS (Docker)

# 2. NLB
- NLB directly see the client IP
