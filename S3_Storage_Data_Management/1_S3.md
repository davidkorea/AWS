# 1. Basics
- By default, you can create up to 100 buckets in each of your AWS accounts. 
  - If you need additional buckets, you can increase your account bucket limit to a maximum of 1,000 buckets by submitting a service limit increase.

# 2. Objects
- **Key**. The key is the FULL path:
  - <my_bucket>/my_file.txt
  - <my_bucket>/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
- **Value**s are the content of the body:
  - Max Size is 5TB
  - If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”, NO Console
    - You can use **S3 Transfer Acceleration** with **multipart uploads**

- **Metadata** (list of text key / value pairs – system or user metadata)
- **Tags** (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle
- **Version ID** (if versioning is enabled)

# 3. S3 Lifecycle
- can you implement to expire incomplete multipart uploads

# 4. S3 Inventory
- Amazon S3 inventory helps manage your storage
- **Audit and report** on the **replication and encryption status of your objects**
- Use cases:
  - Business
  - Compliance 合规
  - Regulatory needs 监管
- You can query all the data using Amazon Athena, Redshift, Presto, Hive,Spark…
- You can setup multiple inventories
- Data goes from a source bucket to a target bucket (need to setup policy)

# 5. S3 Analytics – Storage Class Analysis
- You can setup analytics to help determine **when to transition objects from Standard to Standard_IA**
- Does not work for ONEZONE_IA or GLACIER
- Report is updated on a daily basis
- Takes about 24h to 48h hours to first start
- This helps you put together Lifecycle Rules! 有助于分析后进行tiering
