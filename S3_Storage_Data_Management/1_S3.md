# 1. Basics
- By default, you can create up to 100 buckets in each of your AWS accounts. 
  - If you need additional buckets, you can increase your account bucket limit to a maximum of 1,000 buckets by submitting a service limit increase.


# 2. Objects
- **Key**. The key is the FULL path:
  - <my_bucket>/my_file.txt
  - <my_bucket>/my_folder1/another_folder/my_file.txt
- **Value**s are the content of the body:
  - Max Size is 5TB
  - If uploading more than 5GB, must use “multi-part upload”, NO Console
- **Metadata** (list of text key / value pairs – system or user metadata)
- **Tags** (Unicode key / value pair – up to 10) – useful for security / lifecycle
- **Version ID** (if versioning is enabled)
